<p>In Scratch, I can make a platformer which is where you control a character on a platform hence the name <strong>platform</strong>er.You have to try and avoid obstacles and try not to die.I can do this with the help of Kaname, my coding buddy. I can also use vriables to keep track of the score and even make a highscore which I make using a cloud variable which is a different type for saving numbers.</p>
